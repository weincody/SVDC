SHEAR (Sample Heterogeneity Estimation and Assembly by Reference)
Version:  0.2.14 (beta)
Website:  http://vk.cs.umn.edu/SHEAR/

This is the README file for the SHEAR program. SHEAR is in active development.
Please check the above website for newer available versions. Please contact the
developers at landman@cs.umn.edu to report any problems or for additional help.





### DEPENDENCIES ###

SHEAR has a number of dependencies that are required for installing and running:

GATK         http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/
Picard Tools http://picard.sourceforge.net
SAMtools     http://samtools.sourceforge.net/
BWA          http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/
CREST        http://www.stjuderesearch.org/site/lab/zhang

SHEAR leverages SV detection to improve the assembly process. This beta version
of SHEAR must use CREST for this purpose, but future versions will allow for
plugins of additional SV detection algorithms. BWA is used for local
re-alignment. GATK, Picard Tools, and SAMtools are used for processing SAM/BAM
files.





### INSTALLATION ###

1. Edit the configure-shear file to set the path to GATK. The GATK_JAR_LOCATION
   variable at the top must point to your GenomeAnalysisTK.jar file.

2. Run ./configure-shear to compile SHEAR.

3. Before running SHEAR, you must have the bwa and samtools programs included in
   your PATH environment variable. The gfServer program is also required to be
   in your PATH for CREST to work (see CREST documentation).

4. Before running SHEAR, the CREST_DIRECTORY environment variable must be set
   to point to your CREST installation directory (i.e. the folder that contains
   extractSClip.pl and CREST.pl). The PICARD_DIRECTORY environment variable
   must also be set to point to your Picard directory (i.e. the folder that
   contains CleanSam.jar, AddOrReplaceReadGroups.jar, and
   FixMateInformation.jar).
   For example:
     export CREST_DIRECTORY=/your/path/to/crest
     export PICARD_DIRECTORY=/your/path/to/picard-tools-1.X





### USAGE ###

There are two modules to use when running SHEAR.

SHEAR-SV will process a BAM alignment file to find SVs, SNPs, and INDELs and
estimate the heterogeneity level of those variants. It will output *.report
files reporing the variants and their heterogeneity levels, and it will output
*.sdi files that can be used for SHEAR-Assemble to reconstruct the new genome.

Note that heterogeneity estimates are estimates of the inter-cellular
heterogeneity, with the assumption that all variants are homozygous within
cells (i.e. present on both chromosomes). So a heterogeneity estimation of 50%
for a variant could suggest that 50% of the cells in the sequencing sample are
homozygous for the variant, or that 100% of the cells in the sequencing sample
are heterozygous for the deletion.

SHEAR-Assemble takes a reference genome and a *.sdi file to create a new
personal genome.

To run SHEAR-SV, the usage is:
java -jar SHEAR.jar sv [options]

Options:
    -p <prefix>                        Prefix for all generated files. Required.

    -b <bam_file>                      BAM alignment file containing the input
                                       sequences to the assembly. Must have BAM
                                       index file (i.e. *.bam.bai) in same
                                       directory. Required.

    -f <fasta_reference_file>          Reference file (FASTA format) to be used
                                       for guiding assembly. Must have FASTA
                                       index file (i.e. *.fa.fai) and dictionary
                                       file (i.e. *.dict) in same directory.
                                       Required.

    -i <bwa_index_prefix>              Prefix of the BWA index files for this
                                       reference (i.e. <bwa_index_prefix>.sa,
                                       <bwa_index_prefix>.pac, etc.). Uses
                                       <fasta_reference_file> by default.

    -t <two_bit_reference_file>        Reference file (2bit format) to be used
                                       for guiding assembly. Required.

    -r <region>                        Region of the input alignment to analyze
                                       (i.e. "chr1" for full chromosome or
                                       "chr1:10000-15000" for a particular
                                       region, including endpoints). Coordinates
                                       are 1-based. Optional.

    --preds <crest_pred_file>          Pre-existing *.predSV.txt file generated
                                       by CREST for this alignment. Can be
                                       useful to use if CREST has already been
                                       run on this alignment independently, or
                                       if SHEAR was interrupted and you want to
                                       continue from the previous intermediary
                                       results. Optional.

    --min-het <min_het_threshold>      Minimum estimated heterogeneity level for
                                       a variant to be included in the results.
                                       Must be a numeric value between 0 and 1
                                       (i.e. "--min-het 0.2" would only output
                                       variants that have an estimated).
                                       heterogeneity level of at least 20%.
                                       Optional.

    --sv-only                          "SV Only" prediction mode. Will skip
                                       SNP/INDEL prediction and only return
                                       *.sdi and *.report results for SVs.

    -d                                 Debugging mode. Will keep all
                                       intermediary files and produce more
                                       verbose output information.

The gfServer program requires a 2bit reference file. This can be created using
the faToTwoBit program that comes bundled with blat
(http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/src/).

To run SHEAR-Assemble, the usage is:
java -jar SHEAR.jar assemble [options]

Options:
    -s <sdi_file>                      SDI file produced by SHEAR's 'sv' command
                                       containing the SVs to use to create the
                                       new genomic sequence.

    -f <fasta_reference_file>          Reference file (FASTA format) to be used
                                       for guiding assembly.

    -o <output_fasta_file>             FASTA file to output. Required.

    -d                                 Debugging mode. Will keep all
                                       intermediary files and produce more
                                       verbose output information.

SHEAR-SV may produce SV calls that overlap with each other. If the *.sdi file is
left as is, SHEAR-Assemble will skip over SVs that overlap with ones already
processed while constructing the new genome. The *.sdi file can be modified
before running SHEAR-Assemble to select only the SVs of interest. A future
version of SHEAR will help automate this step.





### TEST DATA ###

This SHEAR package comes bundled with some test data in the test-data directory
to help verify proper installation and understand how to run SHEAR.

The simulated-data.bam file contains paired-end reads sampled from a variant of
the syn.fa sequence that contains three deletions present in 100% of the
sequencing sample. Running SHEAR-SV on this alignment data should produce the
simulated-data.*.sdi and simulated-data.*.report files. For example:

export CREST_DIRECTORY=/your/path/to/crest
export PICARD_DIRECTORY=/your/path/to/picard-tools-1.X
java -jar SHEAR.jar sv -p simulated-data -b simulated-data.bam -f syn.fa \
  -i syn.fa -t syn.2bit

The variant personal genome can then be assembled using SHEAR-Assemble as
follows:
java -jar SHEAR.jar assemble -s simulated-data.sdi -f syn.fa \
  -o simualated-data.fa





### CHANGE LOG ###

v0.2.14 (Mar 15 2015)
- Fixed a bug that would throw an error if SV breakpoints occurred too close to the edge of a FASTA region.

v0.2.13 (Dec 29 2014)
- Now compatible with the latest versions of Picard (i.e. 1.124+).
- Fixed a bug with SDI output when translocations are predicted. These are not supposed to show up in SDI files (although support is coming soon) but were getting inserted as null values.
- Fixed a bug that would throw an error when parsing the -r parameter (i.e. region) for some sequence names.
- General performance improvements.

v0.2.12 (Sep 11 2014)
- Now compatible with the latest versions of GATK (i.e. 3.2+). The configure_shear script will detect the version of GATK being used and configure the class paths correctly.
- Changed how SHEAR interfaces with Picard. Note that now Picard is not referenced during SHEAR compilation, but instead the PICARD_DIRECTORY environment variable should be set at runtime. This should solve various problems that would occur when running SHEAR with conflicting versions of GATK and Picard.

v0.2.11 (Jul 12 2014)
- Now compatible with the latest versions of Picard (i.e. 1.114+). The configure_shear script will detect the version of Picard being used and configure the class paths correctly.
- Fixed a bug with SHEAR-Assemble that was throwing an error in some situations when it should have been skipping over an overlapping variants.

v0.2.10 (Jun 15 2014)
- Added a new parameter (i.e. --min-het) for SHEAR-SV that allows for a minimum threshold for the estimated heterogeneity level in order for variants to be included in the results.
- Fixed a bug with SHEAR-Assemble that was incorrectly processing input FASTA files with whitespace characters in the sequence header lines.

v0.2.9 (Apr 22 2014)
- Fixed some compilation issues for certain versions of GATK and Picard.
- Fixed a bug that would cause SHEAR to crash when provided with input BAM files containing poorly-formatted CIGAR strings, a known issue with certain versions of BWA.
- Added additional validation for correctly-formatted *.2bit files. This will prevent SHEAR from stalling indefinitely when provided with bad *.2bit files.

v0.2.8 (Feb 11 2014)
- SHEAR now automatically runs cleanup on BAM input files to fix common formatting errors before processing.

v0.2.7 (Jan 28 2014)
- Fixed a bug that would result in SNPs not being properly represented in the output SDI files.
- Output report files now contain reference/variant bases for SNPs, deletions, insertions, and inversions.

v0.2.6 (Nov 14 2013)
- Fixed a bug that would throw an error for certain types of inversion SVs.
- Fixed cleanup of temporary files.
- Fixed a bug related to processing alignments with no detectable SVs.

v0.2.5 (Oct 30 2013)
- Fixed a minor bug that would throw an error during local realignment for bad SAM flags in BWA-SW output.

v0.2.4 (Oct 21 2013)
- Fixed minor bugs that would occasionally prevent gfServer from locating a valid open port to use.

v0.2.3 (Sep 18 2013)
- Improvements to the local re-alignment algorithm. Soft-clipped reads should mostly remain in their original neighborhoods now, rather than jump to the corresponding breakpoint.
- Added a "--preds" option that can specify a pre-existing CREST prediction file (i.e. *.predSV.txt) to be used to begin the SHEAR pipeline. This is useful if CREST has already been run on the alignment, so that that doesn't have to be repeated, or to resume a previous run of SHEAR that exited.
- Minor improvements to output log information.

v0.2.2 (Sep 9 2013)
- Fixed a bug that was would occasionally cause gfServer to start improperly and hang if two instances of SHEAR were started at nearly the same time on the same node. This was due to both instances of gfServer attempting to reserver the same port number.

v0.2.1 (Sep 6 2013)
- SHEAR-SV now has support for SNP/INDEL calling via GATK's HaplotypeCaller. SNPs and INDELs will be predicted on the original alignment and their heterogeneity level will be estimated. These will be included in the outputted SDI file to be used by SHEAR-Assemble. SHEAR can be limited to detecting and assembling SVs only via the "--sv-only" option for SHEAR-SV.
- Added an argument to run SHEAR-SV on only a select region or locus in the alignment (e.g. -r chr1:10000-15000).
- Now accepts relative path for 2bit file instead of only absolute path.
- Less clutter outputted in normal (i.e. non-debug) mode.
- Slight speed improvements.
- Various code cleanup, especially with error handling.

v0.1.2 (Jul 9 2013)
- Fixed a bug that caused problems when two instances of SHEAR were run on the same machine at near the same time due to colliding ports for their respective gfServers. The fix requires UNIX's lsof and pgrep commands to be on the PATH, so Windows support is dropped for now. Hopefully this will be added back in a future version.
- Fixed a bug that caused the SHEAR process to hang after an error if gfServer is still open.
- Read groups are no longer required for input BAM alignment. If read group information is missing it will be automatically added by SHEAR.

v0.1.1 (May 13 2013)
- Original release
